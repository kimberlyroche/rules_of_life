TO DO FOR RULES OF LIFE:
(1) bootstrap autocorrelation calculations to give estimate of uncertainty
(2) extend autocorrelation to months and years by resolving differences at month level
(3) redo sampled VC analysis with batch components for "plate", "flow_cell_lane", "library_pool", and perhaps "extract_dna_conc_ng"
(4) sensitivity of these results to zero-filtering of data
(5) what biological questions in the grant can we realistically answer?
